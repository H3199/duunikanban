    "description": "We\u2019re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n  \n  \nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n  \n  \nWe\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n  \n  \n**About The Role And How We Work**\nHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Colin, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just\n*hums along*\n.\n  \n  \nOur infrastructure is in a good place\n*for now*\n. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n  \n  \nHaving herded plenty of\n*snowflakeservers*\nin the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n  \n  \nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n  \n  \n\n- Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler, and create tools to help developers do so\n- Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n- Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n- Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n- Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n- Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n  \n  \nWhy you should or shouldn\u2019t apply\n  \n  \n**You Should Apply If**\n\n- You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n- You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n- You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n- You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n- You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\n**Role**\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n  \n  \n\n- You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n- You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n- You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n- Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n- You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\nTechnology Stack\n  \n  \nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n  \n  \nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n  \n  \nWhat We\u2019re Building\n  \n  \nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us\n**better**\nat what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n  \n  \nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n  \n  \nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the\n*highest*\nstandard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n  \n  \nEngineering Culture\n  \n  \nOur Engineering Culture Is Motivated By Abhik And Benji\u2019s (our Co-founders) Belief That a Small Talented Team, Given The Right Environment, Can Build High-quality Software Fast (and Work Regular Hours!). We Do It Through\n  \n  \n\n- Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n- Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n- Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n- Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n**Minimal Process & Lots of Ownership**\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n  \n  \nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n  \n  \nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do\n*thrive*\n.\n  \n  \n**Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate**\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here).\n  \n  \nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n  \n  \nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n  \n  \n**Increase Leverage, not Team Size**\nWe Built Ashby With The Quality, Breadth, And Depth That Many Customers Would Expect From Much Larger Teams Over Larger Time Scales. We\u2019ve Done This Through Investment In\n  \n  \n\n- Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n- Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\n**And a Demo Of One Of These Building Blocks**\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n  \n  \n**Put Effort into Diversity**\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n  \n  \nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n  \n  \nInterview Process\n  \n  \nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n  \n  \n**Our Interview Process Is Three Rounds**\n\n- Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n- A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n- Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an\n*additional*\n30m screen with a recruiter.\n  \n  \nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n  \n  \n**Your First Three Months at Ashby**\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n  \n  \nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n  \n  \n**Benefits**\n\n- Competitive salary and equity.\n- 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n- Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n- A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n- Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n- $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n- If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n  \n  \n*Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.*",

    "description": "We\u2019re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n  \n  \nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n  \n  \nWe\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n  \n  \n**About The Role And How We Work**\nHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Colin, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just\n*hums along*\n.\n  \n  \nOur infrastructure is in a good place\n*for now*\n. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n  \n  \nHaving herded plenty of\n*snowflakeservers*\nin the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n  \n  \nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n  \n  \n\n- Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler, and create tools to help developers do so\n- Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n- Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n- Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n- Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n- Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n  \n  \nWhy you should or shouldn\u2019t apply\n  \n  \n**You Should Apply If**\n\n- You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n- You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n- You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n- You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n- You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\n**Role**\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n  \n  \n\n- You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n- You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n- You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n- Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n- You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\nTechnology Stack\n  \n  \nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n  \n  \nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n  \n  \nWhat We\u2019re Building\n  \n  \nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us\n**better**\nat what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n  \n  \nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n  \n  \nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the\n*highest*\nstandard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n  \n  \nEngineering Culture\n  \n  \nOur Engineering Culture Is Motivated By Abhik And Benji\u2019s (our Co-founders) Belief That a Small Talented Team, Given The Right Environment, Can Build High-quality Software Fast (and Work Regular Hours!). We Do It Through\n  \n  \n\n- Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n- Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n- Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n- Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n**Minimal Process & Lots of Ownership**\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n  \n  \nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n  \n  \nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do\n*thrive*\n.\n  \n  \n**Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate**\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here).\n  \n  \nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n  \n  \nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n  \n  \n**Increase Leverage, not Team Size**\nWe Built Ashby With The Quality, Breadth, And Depth That Many Customers Would Expect From Much Larger Teams Over Larger Time Scales. We\u2019ve Done This Through Investment In\n  \n  \n\n- Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n- Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\n**And a Demo Of One Of These Building Blocks**\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n  \n  \n**Put Effort into Diversity**\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n  \n  \nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n  \n  \nInterview Process\n  \n  \nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n  \n  \n**Our Interview Process Is Three Rounds**\n\n- Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n- A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n- Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an\n*additional*\n30m screen with a recruiter.\n  \n  \nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n  \n  \n**Your First Three Months at Ashby**\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n  \n  \nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n  \n  \n**Benefits**\n\n- Competitive salary and equity.\n- 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n- Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n- A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n- Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n- $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n- If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n  \n  \n*Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.*",

Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n  \n  \nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n  \n  \nWe\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n  \n  \n**About The Role And How We Work**\nHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Colin, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just\n*hums along*\n.\n  \n  \nOur infrastructure is in a good place\n*for now*\n. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n  \n  \nHaving herded plenty of\n*snowflakeservers*\nin the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n  \n  \nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n  \n  \n\n- Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler, and create tools to help developers do so\n- Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n- Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n- Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n- Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n- Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n  \n  \nWhy you should or shouldn\u2019t apply\n  \n  \n**You Should Apply If**\n\n- You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n- You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n- You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n- You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n- You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\n**Role**\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n  \n  \n\n- You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n- You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n- You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n- Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n- You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\nTechnology Stack\n  \n  \nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n  \n  \nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n  \n  \nWhat We\u2019re Building\n  \n  \nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us\n**better**\nat what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n  \n  \nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n  \n  \nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the\n*highest*\nstandard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n  \n  \nEngineering Culture\n  \n  \nOur Engineering Culture Is Motivated By Abhik And Benji\u2019s (our Co-founders) Belief That a Small Talented Team, Given The Right Environment, Can Build High-quality Software Fast (and Work Regular Hours!). We Do It Through\n  \n  \n\n- Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n- Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n- Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n- Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n**Minimal Process & Lots of Ownership**\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n  \n  \nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n  \n  \nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do\n*thrive*\n.\n  \n  \n**Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate**\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here).\n  \n  \nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n  \n  \nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n  \n  \n**Increase Leverage, not Team Size**\nWe Built Ashby With The Quality, Breadth, And Depth That Many Customers Would Expect From Much Larger Teams Over Larger Time Scales. We\u2019ve Done This Through Investment In\n  \n  \n\n- Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n- Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\n**And a Demo Of One Of These Building Blocks**\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n  \n  \n**Put Effort into Diversity**\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n  \n  \nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n  \n  \nInterview Process\n  \n  \nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n  \n  \n**Our Interview Process Is Three Rounds**\n\n- Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n- A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n- Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an\n*additional*\n30m screen with a recruiter.\n  \n  \nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n  \n  \n**Your First Three Months at Ashby**\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n  \n  \nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n  \n  \n**Benefits**\n\n- Competitive salary and equity.\n- 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n- Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n- A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n- Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n- $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n- If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n  \n  \n*Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

    "description": "Intro\n  \n  \nAt Pleo, we\u2019re on a mission to revolutionise the way businesses manage company spending. No more outdated processes, clunky spreadsheets, or frustrating delays - we believe spend management should be seamless, empowering, and surprisingly effective for finance teams and employees alike. We\u2019re creating tools that promote autonomy, foster trust, and let businesses focus on what truly matters.\n  \n  \nOur culture is built on transparency, collaboration, and a deep commitment to innovation \u2013 which is reflected in our spending solution. At Pleo, you\u2019ll join a passionate team shaping the future of work, all while having some fun along the way.\n  \n  \n**About The Role**\nIn this role, you will work with our core infrastructure, everything from how our cloud providers (AWS and GCP) are configured through Terraform to how our microservices are deployed to Kubernetes and being monitored. You can see a more detailed list below of the things we work with. We believe that you have worked in some of them and that you\u2019ll quickly learn the rest on the job. Working with all these tools and the wide scope of the team can be daunting, but you will work in a large SRE team where teamwork is highly encouraged.\n  \n  \n**Please note this role will be open for applications until Thursday 20th November 2025 09.00 GMT.**\n**We will not review any applications before the closing date so there is no rush to apply, ensure you take the time to submit a high quality application.**\nWhat you\u2019ll be doing\n  \n  \nIn the SRE team, you can expect to:\n  \n  \n\n- Design, implement, and maintain reliable, scalable infrastructure that supports our platform and application services\n- Contribute to SRE standards and tooling, helping evolve our infrastructure-as-code, observability stack, and service reliability framework\n- Collaborate with other engineers to resolve production incidents and contribute to post-incident reviews and improvements\n- Plan and execute upgrades of core infrastructure systems (e.g. EKS, databases, Kafka clusters), minimising downtime and effort required by other teams\n- Learn and grow within a supportive team, developing deeper expertise in cloud infrastructure, automation, and observability\n\nIn case you are curious, here is a list of some of the technologies the team is working with: Grafana, AWS (and most of its major services), GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, Flux / GitOps, Istio, GitHub Actions, Go.\n  \n  \nWhat you bring\n  \n  \nYou have worked in established Platform / SRE / Infrastructure teams and have experience working with Kubernetes and managing multiple clusters (10+). Besides that, you are:\n  \n  \n\n- Able to work in English with ease (it's our company language)\n- Curious and love learning about new languages / frameworks / working styles\n- Experienced in solving complex technical challenges at scale\n- Striving for a high bar for quality and reliability within your team\n- Advocating for a more thorough code review process than a quick scroll to the bottom of the page and a \u201cLGTM!\u201d\n- Able to help to design the overall solution instead of \u201cjust\u201d writing code\n- Sought after within your team for help in solving challenging problems\n- A force multiplier within your team - your work enables other engineers to do even better\n- Able to raise and describe technical debt faced by your team, and then able to propose a solution or path forward\n\nWhy is this role a good fit for you\n  \n  \nThis role is for you if:\n  \n  \n\n- You have experience working in Platform / SRE / Infrastructure teams with established practices in large engineering environments (100+ engineers)\n- You have experience with Kubernetes, cloud platforms (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure), and infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform to build and manage reliable systems\n- You are genuinely excited about helping developers and proactively build relationships with them\n\nThis role may not be for you if:\n  \n  \n\n- Your experience has been mostly as a single SRE or very small embedded team.\n- You prefer to focus deeply in one area.

Some of the key reasons why previous candidates didn\u2019t make it past the application screening stage include:\n  \n  \n\n- CV writing and content: it was very clear that many of the CVs we saw were very generic and AI generated. There is no issue with leveraging AI to help with CV writing, there was little indication of what real impact the candidates had in their previous experience. You might have heard of the \u201cAchieved X, as measured by Y, by doing Z\u201d formula (credit Laszlo Bock ~2014), this is a great way to give a clear picture of what you have actually worked on.\n- Application care: every single application we receive is reviewed by a human (yes, hundreds of them) because we believe that candidates' efforts should be matched by an equal level of human care. This means that we expect a similar level of attention put into your application. Read and answer the application questions carefully, they make a huge difference in our decision-making process\n- Profile to role fit: there was misunderstanding about the type of experience we expect from an SRE and we received many applications from candidates who had never been exposed to a product-led environment or had been exclusively focused on release management and CI/CD pipeline work. We\u2019ve taken great care in writing this role description to reflect the reality of the job as best as possible, please ensure you read it carefully and highlight on your CV the experience relevant to what we are looking for\n\n**Why join us?**\nWorking at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means \u2018more than you\u2019d expect\u2019, and it\u2019s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it\u2019s only fitting that we\u2019d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.\n  \n  \nWe think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn\u2019t be siloed from the rest of the organisation \u2013 they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.\n  \n  \nSpeaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is \u2018champion the customer\u2019, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is \u2018succeed as a team\u2019, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also \u2018make it happen\u2019 by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we \u2018build to scale\u2019, creating lasting solutions that address today\u2019s challenges and anticipate tomorrow\u2019s needs.\n  \n  \nSo, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices \u2014and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible\n*and*\nmake sure you still have time to connect with your team.\n  \n  \n**About Your Application**\n\n- Please submit your application in English; it\u2019s our company language so you\u2019ll be speaking lots of it if you join \ud83d\udc95\n- We treat all candidates equally: If you are interested please apply through our application system - any correspondence should come from there! Our lovely support isn't able to pass on any calls/ emails our way - and this makes sure that the candidate experience is smooth and fair to everyone \ud83d\ude0a\n- We\u2019re on a mission to make everyone feel valued at work.
